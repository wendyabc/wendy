#summary The Wendy 3.0 specification and system.

= Background = 

Wendy 1.0 was released 16 August 1971 and added thousands of new features for the first few years. The primary purpose of this release was to birth the initial version then get it to the point where it could vote and go to college.

Around 4 April 1990, Wendy 2.0 was released. This version was focused on establishing a career, marriage, and having a child. It was released in tandem with Partner 1.0 which was found to be an incompatible extension on 4 April 2009.

Work on Wendy 3.0 began on 5 April 2009. The first beta release debuted on 16 August 2009 ([http://www.flickr.com/photos/sp1ral/sets/72157621941656867/ photos of 3.0 beta release party]). Beta tests of the "single/independent," "flirting," and "connecting with strangers" modules were conducted in Black Rock City (1-6 September) that resulted in the beta 2 release on 7 September 2009. Significant changes were made to the partner API on the playa--some modules were deleted and others almost completely rewritten. ([http://www.flickr.com/photos/sp1ral/sets/72157622172154885/ Photos from Burning Man]).

The Candidate Release was originally scheduled for 1 January 2010 but one of the major features, Legally Divorced, was not yet completed. Therefore, the 1 January release was another beta that incorporated all of the evolution since September. It's much more stable that the previous betas and most all of the bugs have been addressed to functional levels (evolution will be ongoing throughout the lifetime of the product).

3.0 was released to market (or released to the massses) on 4 October 2010 after the Legally Divorced feature was finally recorded in the King County books. Note that the date of shipping is "10/4" as in "ten four good buddy."

On 16 August 2011, the first dot release (Wendy 3.4.0) coincided with the Wendy meat ware's 40th annual anniversary of celestial circumference (AACC). An agile release process was adopted that year such that each following year on the AACC a new release would coincide with the anniversary. Thus, 16 August 2014 is the 3.4.3 beta release--the 5 year anniversary of the Wendy 3.0 line. ([http://gilhooly.blogspot.com/2014/08/wendy-30-5-year-retrospective.html Wendy 3.0 5 year anniversary post mortem]). We expect a major dot release every decade hereafter. We anticipate release of Wendy 4.0 (technically Wendy 4.5.7) in 2028, as we begin the next 19 year cycle of the Wendy system.

= Wendy 3.0 = 

The primary feature set for the Wendy 3.0 development cycle included:
  * Redesigned the Partner API
    * Interface with Partner 1.0 is forward-compatible to ensure cooperative care of Child 1.0
    * Interface for future partner extensions has a more thoroughly defined api with better boundary 
    management and fewer energy leaks. 
  * Quicker access to emotions
    * Better access to emotions, gut and heart.
  * Increased reliance on intuitive, intellectual, and emotional systems
  * Increased the number and quality of requests made to other applications
  * Decreased number of cycles wasted on worrying about what other applications are processing
  * Increased the number of connections to other applications
  * Deepened the connections that are made with other applications
  * Installed a "Don't Panic!" button that cause noops until calm is restored.

= Child 1.0 = 

Several of the Wendy 3.0 processes are aimed at creating a stable, loving environment for Child 1.0. Here are some of the features:

  * Creation of an interesting, fun, loving, beautiful, artistic, inspiring, eclectic home. 
  As he gets older, I want home to be a place that he enjoys bringing friends to because they like to hang out here.
  * Several of the primary features for Wendy 3.0 are skills that will help in "emotion coaching" 
  such that Child 1.0 learns to name and process emotions effectively.
  * Establish a grounded, compassionate co-parenting relationship with Partner 1.0 to give Child 1.0 
  as much support as we can.
  * Ensure Wendy 3.0 beta testing doesn't confuse or unnecessarily upset Child 1.0. Set and maintain 
  healthy boundaries with beta testers with respect to access to The Lab and interactions with Child 1.0.
  * Maintain a good balance between work, play, and time spent with Child 1.0. 
  * Continue to learn about parenting and child development. Continue to enjoy the effect that parenting 
  has on my own personal growth.
  
= Partner 2.0: API and data management = 
  
Several of the Partner APIs were taken offline from 2011 to mid-2015. During training for Burning Man 2015, they were brought back online with the intent of testing several of the interfaces on playa. Tests started at Critical Massive. Unexpectedly, a compatible candidate process for Partner 2.0 was found just after the release of 3.4.4 (August 2015). As of the release of 3.4.5 (August 2016), these processes continue to be evolving well together and the current roadmap includes a commitment to continue this evolution for the forseeable future.
