#summary The Wendy 3.0 specification and system.

= Introduction =

== History ==
Wendy 1.0 was released 16 August 1971 and added thousands of new features for the first few years. The primary purpose of this first release was to get the initial version of the software out there and to the point where it could vote independently then go to college.

Around 4 April 1990, Wendy 2.0 was released. This version was heavy on establishing a career, marriage, and having a child. It was released in tandem with Partner 1.0 which was found to be an incompatible extension on 4 April 2009.

Work on Wendy 3.0 began on 5 April 2009. The first beta release debuted on 16 August 2009.

= Partner 2.0 =

I love love. Despite recovering from a broken heart..."a heart that hurts is a heart that works." My heart is so open...but it is also afraid and cautious. That said, here's what I've been dreaming of for a while.

A conforming Partner application will exhibit the following features:
  * Present. Someone who I can talk freely with. If I have a twinge of some feeling, I can bring it up, ask questions, and get an honest, loving answer.
  * Healthy boundaries. Someone who can lean into emotions and discover the information within and use it in a productive way.
  * Someone who loves himself and cares for himself. Knowing that love for others comes from the reservoirs filled as a product of self-love.
  * Someone who views relationships as an adventure--a journey. That we travel together...and apart.
  * In a partnership, I want to maintain my independence. I have a career, family, and art. I want to find a good balance between all of them so that they each feed each other.
  * Someone who is spiritual, loving, learning. Someone who enjoys the journey of life.
  * A romantic who brings me fresh flowers.
  * An idealist who believes we can leave the world better than we found it.
  * Someone who strives to do his best but celebrates failures as learning opportunities.
  * Someone who loves children and wants to be an attentive father and a good role model for my son. Who understands what it will take to integrate into our family and have the patience to work through the process.
  * Someone who asks me questions about how I feel, why I feel that way, and what I want. Someone who will answer questions about how he feels, why he feels that way, and what he wants.
  * Someone who is smart. Likes to read. Prefers to create something or go for a walk than sit around watching t.v. Although, down time is part of it, too. Cooking dinner and watching a movie is a wonderful way to spend a night. Or sitting around reading books or listening to music. Quiet time is good.
  * Someone who accepts me as I am and is supportive of growth and change. Someone who can evolve with me.
  * Someone who is patient and slow to anger. 
  * Someone who can give me space, love and support as I work towards expressing myself better--more freely and honestly. Someone who can express himself, ask for what he wants but can handle "no" and work towards compromise.
  * Someone who is trustworthy, kind, a good person who cares about the well-being of other people.
  * Someone who will volunteer, donate, or work towards making the world a better place for all living things.
  * Someone who cares about where his food comes from--how it is grown and who grows it.
  * Someone who does not use alcohol or drugs to cope but may drink or toke from time-to-time to celebrate.
  * Someone who can be loving and gentle as well as intense and dominate.
  * Someone who likes the arts and will make plans to see an opera or a play or visual arts opening. 
  * Someone who views "home" as an extension of self and therefore part of self-care.
  * Someone who sets and reaches goals.
  * I want to sing along to silly love songs together.
  * I don't want someone to fill in where I lack, likewise I shouldn't be filling a hole for him. I want to amplify the best in each other.
  * Someone who has a good and interesting career but isn't obsessed. He can leave work at the end of the day. Family is priority.
  * Owns his shit. Points out when I need to own mine.
  * Communication communication communication.
  * Sex Sex Sex. Someone who is creative, imaginative, playful, GGG. Understanding that this evolves as well...there is always more to try, do, and be.
  * Believes in magic and ritual.
  * Willing to work with professionals if needed.
  * We should always have a mathematical balance: 1+1=2 (as a couple) 1+1+1=3 (couple+child 1.0) 1+1+1+n=3+n (if additional children are added)
