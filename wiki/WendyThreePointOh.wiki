= Child 1.0 = 

Several of the Wendy 3.0 processes are aimed at creating a stable, loving environment for Child 1.0. Here are some of the features we'd like to see implemented:

  * Creation of an interesting, fun, loving, beautiful, artistic, inspiring, eclectic home. As he gets older, I want home to be a place that he enjoys bringing friends to because they like to hang out here.
  * Several of the primary features for Wendy 3.0 are skills that will help in "emotion coaching" such that Child 1.0 learns to name and process emotions effectively.
  * Establish a grounded, compassionate co-parenting relationship with Partner 1.0 to give Child 1.0 as much support as we can.
  * Ensure Wendy 3.0 beta testing doesn't confuse or unnecessarily upset Child 1.0. Set and maintain healthy boundaries with beta testers with respect to access to The Lab and interactions with Child 1.0.
  * Maintain a good balance between work, play, and time spent with Child 1.0. Ensure that "re-entry" times are just the two of us to help him shift gears.
  * Minimize the number of transitions he experiences each day.
  * Continue to learn about parenting and child development. Continue to enjoy the effect that parenting has on my own personal growth.

Disclaimer: Several bugs will need to be addressed and a future build of Wendy 3.0 will need to be more stable before serious attention is directed toward this module.

I love love. Despite recovering from a broken heart..."a heart that hurts is a heart that works..." My heart is open...and cautious. 

This list not only reflects what I am looking for in someone else but who I hope to be as well.

A conforming Partner application will exhibit the following features:
  * Someone who is present. A good listener. 
  * Someone who sets and respects boundaries. 
  * Someone who can lean into emotions and discover the information within and use it in a productive way.
  * Someone who loves himself and cares for himself.
  * Someone who views relationships as adventures. 
  * Someone who is spiritual, loving, learning. Someone who enjoys the journey of life--one that we sometimes travel together, sometimes apart.
  * A romantic who brings me fresh flowers.
  * An idealist who believes we can leave the world better than we found it.
  * Someone who strives to do his best but celebrates failures as learning opportunities.
  * Someone who loves children and wants to be a positive influence for my son.
  * Someone who is smart. Who likes to read. Who prefers creating something or walking than watching t.v. 
  * Someone who appreciates down time--cooking and watching a movie, reading, listening to music. 
  * Someone who accepts me as I am and is supportive of growth and change. Someone who can evolve with me.
  * Someone who is patient and slow to anger. 
  * Someone who can give me space, love and support as I work towards expressing myself better--more freely and honestly. Someone who can express himself, ask for what he wants but can handle "no" and work towards compromise.

  * Someone who will volunteer, donate, or work towards making the world a better place for all living things.

  * Someone who does not use alcohol or drugs to cope but may drink or toke from time-to-time to celebrate.
  * Someone who can be loving and gentle as well as intense and dominate.
  * Someone who likes the arts and will make plans to see an opera or a play or visual arts opening. 
  * Someone who views "home" as an extension of self and therefore part of self-care.
  * Someone who sets and reaches goals.
  * I want to sing along to silly love songs together.
  * I don't want someone to fill in where I lack, likewise I shouldn't be filling a hole for him. I want to amplify the best in each other.
  * Someone who has a good and interesting career but isn't obsessed. He can leave work at the end of the day. Family is priority.
  * Owns his shit. Points out when I need to own mine.
  * Someone who is sexually creative, imaginative, playful, GGG. 
  * Believes in magic and ritual.
  * Willing to work with professionals if needed.
