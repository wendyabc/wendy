#summary The Wendy 3.0 specification and system.

= Introduction =

== History ==
Wendy 1.0 was released 16 August 1971 and added thousands of new features for the first few years. The primary purpose of this first release was to get the initial version of the software out there and to the point where it could vote and go to college.

Around 4 April 1990, Wendy 2.0 was released. This version was focused on establishing a career, marriage, and having a child. It was released in tandem with Partner 1.0 which was found to be an incompatible extension on 4 April 2009.

Work on Wendy 3.0 began on 5 April 2009. The first beta release debuted on 16 August 2009 ([http://www.flickr.com/photos/sp1ral/sets/72157621941656867/ photos of 3.0 beta release party]). Beta tests of the "single/independent," "flirting," and "connecting with strangers" modules were conducted in Black Rock City (1-6 September) that resulted in the beta 2 release on 7 September 2009. Significant changes were made to the partner API on the playa--some modules were deleted and others almost completely rewritten.

The primary feature set for the Wendy 3.0 development cycle includes:
  * Redesigning the Partner API
    * Interface with Partner 1.0 needs to be forward-compatible to ensure cooperative care of Child 1.0
    * Interface with future partner extensions needs to have a more thoroughly defined api and better beta testing before significant releases
  * Quicker access to emotions
  * Increased reliance on intuitive, intellectual, and emotional systems
  * Increase the number and quality of requests made to other applications
  * Decrease number of cycles wasted on worrying about what other applications are processing
  * Increase the number of connections to other applications
  * Deepen the connections that are made with other applications
  * Installation of a "Don't Panic!" button that will cause noops until calm is restored.

= Child 1.0 = 

Several of the Wendy 3.0 processes are aimed at creating a stable, loving environment for Child 1.0. Here are some of the features we'd like to see implemented:

  * Creation of an interesting, fun, loving home that Child 1.0. As he gets older, I want home to be a place that he enjoys bringing friends to because they like to hang out here.
  * Several of the primary features for Wendy 3.0 are skills that will help in "emotion coaching" such that Child 1.0 learns to name and process emotions effectively.
  * Establish a grounded, compassionate co-parenting relationship with Partner 1.0 to give Child 1.0 as much support as we can.
  * Ensure Wendy 3.0 beta testing doesn't confuse or unnecessarily upset Child 1.0. Set and maintain healthy boundaries with beta testers with respect to access to The Lab and interactions with Child 1.0.
  * Maintain a good balance between work, play, and time spent with Child 1.0. Ensure that "re-entry" times are just the two of us to help him shift gears.
  * Minimize the number of transitions he experiences each day.
  * Continue to learn about parenting and child development. Continue to enjoy the effect that parenting has on my own personal growth.

= Partner 2.0 =

Disclaimer: Several bugs will need to be addressed and a future build of Wendy 3.0 will need to be more stable before serious attention is directed toward this module.
